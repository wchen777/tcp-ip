- How big can an IP packet get? If it's over 1400 bytes, should we split it into multiple IP packets and send them over the link layer? How can we tell when to stop if we do split it into different frames? 

- Understanding interfaces -- interface IP address vs. host IP address, sending packets through interfaces (does A's interface have to know about B's interface), is the connection between interfaces learned?
